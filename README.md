# Emoji2048

## What it is
A Twitter bot that plays 2048 with user input. It tweets a grid every ten minutes and waits for player responses. It then takes a random suggestion and posts another tweet with the new state of the grid, the move that was chosen, the available moves and the total number of movements made.
This bot was made as a submission to Royal Hackaway 2019. You can find more information [here](https://devpost.com/software/emoji2048).

## How to run
Clone the repository and run `npm start`. You'll have to replace the API keys with your own.


Thanks to Hannah, Male and V for helping me to test the bot.
